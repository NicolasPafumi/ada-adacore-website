        <h2> Abstract </h2>
        <p>It is a well-known fact: presidential elections shake up the stock market every four years. 
            Investors react nervously to uncertainty, worry about potential policy changes, often amplifying even small market fluctuations. 
            Understanding these dynamics can help anticipate market movements and hedge portfolios around election cycles —or 
            or at least give analysts an excuse to dive deep into charts and election data late into the night. More importantly, 
            market movements reveal how investors perceive candidates and their policy proposals.
            <br>
            In this post, we take a data-driven look at how presidential elections affect company performance and investor 
            behavior over time. Using historical stock market data, election results, and prediction market trends, 
            we track how markets react as the likelihood of a candidate winning change. Particularly interesting is how 
            different sectors-technology, energy, healthcare, finance-respond to the uncertainty and outcomes of election cycles.
            <br>
            The goal is simple: to show how politics and markets “dance” together, based on data, while keeping the discussion 
            accessible. By analyzing past elections and looking ahead to the upcoming 2024 election, we hope to identify patterns 
            that explain when, why, and how the market gets nervous.
        </p>

        <h3>Research questions</h3>
        <p>
            <ul>
            <li>Can we describe the behavior of an entire sector? </li>
            <li>Do sectors show significant patterns in shared financial behavior, and are they affected differently?</li>
            <li>Which sectors respond most strongly to presidential elections? </li>
            <li>What characteristics of elections trigger increased market volatility? </li>
            <li>Does the president’s party have differential effects on certain sectors? </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
            To answer these questions, we
            will use historical stock market data and publicly available election data. We will also use prediction market data as
            proxy for the perceived probability of each candidate winning.
            </p>

        <h3> Nasdaq Insights </h3>
        <p>
            So, what exactly are we looking at when we say “Nasdaq”? Our main dataset is a rich collection of historical stock 
            prices for companies traded on the Nasdaq exchange, along with some ETFs thrown in for context. For those not familiar: 
            ETFs (Exchange-Traded Funds) are like baskets of stocks bundled together—think of them as a way to invest in an entire 
            sector without buying every single company individually. Meanwhile, individual stocks let us zoom in on how specific 
            companies react under market stress, election uncertainty, and all the drama that comes with four-year cycles. 
            <br>
            To make our lives a bit more insightful, we’ve also annotated each ticker with its sector, letting us ask questions like: 
            Does tech freak out more than energy when election season hits? Is healthcare the calm, stoic sibling in the family of market 
            sectors? These sector labels are crucial for understanding sector-specific effects during elections.

        <h2 style="text-align: center;">Dataset Unwrapping</h2>
        <p style="text-align: center;">The number of tickers in our dataset varies over time due to IPOs, 
            delistings, and other corporate events. The graph below illustrates the overall date coverage, 
            showing the number of active stocks and ETFs at each point in time. Notably, the first ETF 
            in our dataset appears in 1993, corresponding to the inception of the S&P 500 ETF, while stocks 
            span a longer historical period.

        <p style="text-align: center;">The following graph shows the date coverage of tickers broken down in 11 sectors, 
            using the standardized international GICS classification. We observe that the number of active tickers generally 
            increases over time. Notably, there is a sharp jump in March 1983, with multiple new listings. As no clear event 
            such as an IPO boom or regulatory change explains this surge, it is likely due to a change in data collection methods 
            or limitations in the data source. To ensure stable results, we therefore restrict our analysis to elections from 1984 onward.

        <h3>Returns and Log-Returns</h3>

        <p>When we want to measure how a stock is performing, the first thing that comes to mind is: 
            how much did it move today? In finance, this is captured by returns. At its simplest, 
            the daily return of a stock is the relative change in price from one day to the next.
        </p>

        <!--Returns-->

            <summary class="info-box">

                    <path d="M6 9l6 6 6-6" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round"
                        stroke-linejoin="round" />
                </svg>
                <span>Returns</span>
            </summary>
            <div class="details-content">
                <p>
                    To compute how much a stock earns we take the difference in value to the next period
                    divided by value at the start of the period.
                </p>
        
                <div class="math-block">
                    $$R = \frac{V_f - V_i}{V_i}$$
                </div>
        
                <p>
                    In practice, we usually use for value the adjusted close prices and for the period days. 
                    Adjusted close prices account for corporate actions like stock splits, dividends, 
                    and spin-offs, so they reflect the true economic value of holding the stock. This 
                    gives us a simple, intuitive sense of performance: positive numbers mean gains, negative numbers mean losses.
                </p>
            </div>
        </details>

        <p>However, a commonly used alternative is the logarithmic return (or log return). Rather than measuring 
            relative change directly, it is defined as the natural logarithm of the ratio of consecutive prices.
        </p>

        <!--Log returns-->
        <details class="collapsible info-dropdown">

                <p>
                    Here we explain in much more details
                </p>
        
                <p>With a nice formula:</p>
        
                <p class="math-block">
                    <!-- MathJax formula -->
                    $$r_t = \ln\frac{V_t}{V_{t-1}}$$
                </p>
                <p>
                    With
                    \(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n\) inline equation.
                </p>
            </div>

            <p>Why go through the trouble? The magic property of log returns is **time additivity**: 
                the log return over multiple days is just the sum of daily log returns. This makes it 
                trivial to compute cumulative returns over a period. For example, if a stock gains 1% 
                on day 1 and loses 1% on day 2, the cumulative log return is exactly zero—something that 
                doesn’t hold with regular returns.
            </p>
            
        </details>

        <h3>Kurtosis</h3>

        <p>
            Kurtosis measures how much of the data lies in the tails of a distribution—essentially, how likely 
            extreme events are. One additional advantage of using log returns is that they tend to reduce kurtosis,
            smoothing out the “fat tails” often seen in standard returns. This makes the distribution closer to normal, 
            which is particularly helpful for statistical analysis, modeling, and comparing sectors or stocks. The differences 
            are subtle and usually invisible in histograms, as they appear mainly in rare, extreme price moves.

        <h3>Alpha and Beta</h3>

        <p>
            Not all stocks move the same way when the market shifts. Beta measures how sensitive a stock is to overall market movements, 
            which we track here using the S&P 500 as the market reference. A beta above 1 means the stock tends to amplify market swings 
            (tech stocks, for example), while a beta below 1 means it’s more stable (utilities are classic examples).
            <br>
            But some companies consistently outperform—or underperform—the market in ways that can’t be explained by beta alone. 
            That’s alpha: positive alpha means the stock does better than expected given its beta, negative alpha means it lags behind.
        </p>

        <!--Alpha and Beta-->

                    Here, \(R_i\) is the stock return, \(R_m\) the market return, 
                    \(\beta_i\) the market sensitivity, \(\alpha_i\) the extra return not 
                    explained by the market, and \(\epsilon_i\) the residual, or abnormal return.

        <h3>Estimators of Volatility</h3>

        <p>
            Returns tend to be centered around 0 as prices oscillate around a trend. During the 2008 crisis, we observe an increase
            in volatility, with more pronounced fluctuations. This pattern of high volatility could be indicative of what we expect
            around election dates as well, although less pronounced. We can quantify this volatility using standard deviation of
            returns over a rolling window. This estimate of volatility is referred to as historical volatility
        </p>

        <!-- historical volatility -->

                    Volatility is the finance term for the standard deviation. It can be computed using usual unbiased

                    deviation formula with a rolling window.

                    \(N\) the selected window, e.g. \(t\) representing a day, \( \bar{V} \) the average price for the
                    given window and
                    \(V_t\) the price on a given \(t\) (e.g. a day).

        <p>
            Sectors typically follow the overall market trend, with increased volatility during events affecting the entire economy,
            such as the 2008 financial crisis or the August 2011 market fall. However, this simple visualization hints that sectors
            can exhibit different levels of volatility, responding to events that preferentially impact them. A good example is the
            energy sector that showed above-market volatility from 2005 to 2007, as conflicts in the Middle East and other factors
            influenced oil prices. Other sectors were largely unaffected during that period. Similarly, the years 2001-2003 saw
            increased volatility in the technology sector following the burst of the dot-com bubble, while other sectors remained
            relatively stable.
        </p>

        <P>
            This already supports our hypothesis that sector-specific analysis is important to capture the full impact of elections.
            As candidates take different stances on issues like climate change, regulation of Big Tech or healthcare reform, sectors
            will be differentially affected!
        </P>

        <p>
            while historical volatility is easy to compute and is typically used for long-term analysis and risk management, it has
            its limitations. It needs a sufficiently large window size to provide reliable estimates, which can smooth out the
            day-to-day fluctuations we aim to capture around election dates. Additionally, since it is only based on close prices,
            it ignores intraday price movements. In the context of elections, market reactions can be swift and get resolved within
            the same trading day. For these reasons, we use Parkinson's volatility estimator, which leverages high and low prices
            within the trading day to provide a more responsive measure

        <h2>How do you describe the performance of an entire sector? Does it make sense to talk of sector?</h2>

        <h3>Does it make economic sense: correlations</h3>

        <p>
            financial definition of a sector: sharing risks. yahoo finance provides 11 sector denominations? Is it just our tendency
            to categorize or is there really an economic reality of similar reactions within a sector? Is the distinction
            economically sound? we selected and visualized corr.

        <p>
            This analysis reveals that intra-sector correlations are consistently higher than inter-sector correlations as expected.
            However, inter-sector correlations vary depending on the event. For example, during the 2008 financial Crisis, the
            Consumer Defensive sector correlated strongly with Energy and Healthcare stocks. Events with broad economic impacts
            introduce systemic risks that affect multiple sectors simultaneously, leading to higher correlations across the board.
            The same holds true for the Covid-19 crash.
        </p>

        <p>
            Most interestingly, we see that the 2016 election had the effect of lowering correlations across sectors, even when
            compared to a 20-year correlation baseline. The election seems to "uncouple" sectors from each other. This further
            supports our hypothesis that elections lead to idiosyncratic responses across sectors, as candidates propose policies
            that differentially impact various industries.
        </p>

        <h3>If it does, how do you represent entire sector</h3>

        <p>
            So far, we've used sector-specific ETFs as proxies for the performance and volatility of the entire sectors. This ETF
            family, called Select Sector SPDRs, is a well-established way to track sector performance. [what they are used for, in
            academia, to diversify portfolios] They each contain the companies of their respective sectors that appear in the S&P
            500 index. Each company is weighted by its market capitalization, with around 50% of holding typically concentrated in
            the top 10 companies. This is a better way to track sector volatility than averaging the volatility of all companies in
            the sector for two reasons:
        </p>

        <p>
            1. Large companies affect sector performance more than small companies. A non-weighted average would give equal
            importance to all companies.
            2. Small companies have higher volatility than big companies. This volatility may not be due to sector sentiment but
            rather to the fact that small companies are traded in lower volumes and can be thus be affected by modest day-to-day
            trades. This would artificially inflate sector volatility.
        </p>

        <p>
            Let us verify this by calculating volatility as an average of individual stock volatilities within each sector and
            comparing it to the ETF volatility.
        </p>

        <p>
            The histograms on the left show that on any specific day, the distribution of volatilities for companies within the same
            sector is right-skewed. Most companies have volatilities clustered around a central value, but a few outliers exhibit
            very high volatilities. This confirms our earlier assumption that small companies, more sensitive to day-to-day trading,
            will skew the average. In the healthcare sector, for example, the outlier is TLGT (Teligent Inc.) reaching a volatility
            0f 0.36. At the time of measurement, Teligent was a small pharmaceutical company with a market capitalization of only
            $10 million.
        </p>

        <p>
            It is thus no surprise that our naive sector volatility calculation consistently overestimates sector volatility as
            shown on the lineplots on the right. However, we are surprised to see that while the naive calculation is an
            overestimation, it nonetheless reproduces closely historical patterns over two decades and is not as noisy as we
            expected. Using the median instead of the mean to aggregate individual stock volatilities slightly improves the
            estimate, but it still remains an overestimation.
        </p>

        <p>
            From now on, we will use sector ETFs to study sector variations for computation efficiency.

        <h2>Event study</h2>

        <p>
            How does one determine how a specific event impacted the performance or volatility of a stock? Tools from event study
            methodology help us answer such questions. Our study will go as follows:
        </p>

        <p>
            - Define an event window around Election Day, the event of interest: we consider both pre- and post-election windows as
            the dates of elections are known and changes in the market could even happen before as investors try to anticipate the
            outcome or hedge their positions.
            - Calculate realized returns or volatility over that window.
            - Compare these values to expected returns and volatility: event studies differ by how they define these expected, or
            normal, values. We will demonstrate two approaches.
            - Aggregate results across different sectors and election cycles and determine statistical significance.
        </p>

        <h3>Abnormal returns based event study</h3>

        <p>
            let us use abnormal returns to evaluate election impact. abnormal returns defined using alpha and beta, explain why:
        </p>

        <p>
            By ignoring these factors, a naive model may misattribute as event-driven and abnormal returns that simply due to the
            sector's historical characteristics. We thus account for the relationship between sector returns and market returns
            using linear regression. The market model is defined as follows:
        </p>

        <p>
            $$
            R_{i,t} = \alpha_i + \beta_i R_{m,t} + \epsilon_{i,t}
            $$
        </p>

        <p>
            where \( \alpha_i \) is the stock's alpha, \( \beta_i \) is the stock's beta, and \( \epsilon_{i,t} \) is the return not
            explained by the model, aka the abnormal return:
        </p>

        <p>
            $$
            AR_{i,t} = R_{i,t} - (\alpha_i + \beta_i R_{m,t})
            $$
        </p>

        <p>
            It is customary to estimate \( \alpha_i \) and \( \beta_i \) over a large window prior to the window of interest. In our
            example, we will define a 252-day estimation window, corresponding to one trading year. We can then aggregate these
            abnormal returns across our event window to obtain cumulative abnormal returns (CAR):
        </p>

        <p>
            $$
            CAR_{i,t} = \sum_{m \leq t} AR_{i,m}
            $$
        </p>

        <p>
            Let us use this method to analyze the impact of the 2016 presidential election on different sectors.
        </p>

            [graph qui ressemble à celui de elsa: choose one particular election, you get 2 graphs, left for abnormal return

        </p>

        <img src="assets/img/placeholders/ph8.png">

        <p>
            Look at 2016 for example:<br>
            Visualizing pre- and post-election cumulative abnormal returns shows the sector most impacted by results of the 2016
            presidential election is the energy sector, with a significant cumulative abnormal return of 0.06 over 20 days, crushing
            other sectors. This is consistent with the pro-fossil fuel of the elected Trump administration, as well as the
            expectations of climate deregulation. The lineplot also illustrates a jump in abnormal returns the day of the election,
            as the winner was announced.
        </p>

        <p>
            Funnily enough, pre-election CAR was negative for the energy sector. Those of us who followed the 2016 election remember
            that Hillary Clinton, the more environmentally conscious candidate, was initially predicted to win the election before
            Trump's electoral victory surprised many. This headline from the Wall Street Journal perfectly captures the market
            sentiment that led to the energy sector's soar.
