        <h2> Abstract </h2>
        <p>This week, we are diving into one of the few events that reliably make investors bite their nails every four years: presidential elections. 
            Markets don’t like uncertainty, and when policies, regulations, and the general economic direction are up in the air, even small market moves can get amplified 
            as investors adjust their bets.
            Understanding these dynamics can help anticipate market movements and hedge portfolios around election cycles - or, for the data enthusiasts among us, 
            serve as a perfectly legitimate excuse to spend late nights buried in charts and election data. More importantly, 
            market movements reveal how investors perceive candidates and their policy proposals.
            <br>
            In this post, we dig into the numbers to see how elections actually move the market. Rather than looking at individual stocks, 
            we zoom out to the sector level - technology, energy, healthcare, financials, and more - and ask: do these sectors all react the same way, 
            or does each chart its own course when the political winds shift?
            We rely on historical stock data, election outcomes, and contextual details from multiple election cycles to explore these patterns. 
            <br>
            The goal is simple: to show how politics and markets “dance” together, with real data leading the steps. By looking across multiple election 
            cycles, we hope to uncover patterns that explain when, why, and how markets get jittery, all while keeping the story readable 
            (and maybe a little entertaining) for anyone curious about the intersection of elections and finance.
        </p>

        <h3>Research questions</h3>
        <p>
            <ul>
            <li>Do different stock market sectors, such as Technology, Healthcare, or Financials, respond differently to presidential elections? </li>
            <li>Are certain sectors systematically favored under Democratic or Republican administrations?</li>
            <li>Do sector-level returns following elections exhibit consistent patterns, and if so, could these patterns plausibly be exploited? </li>
            <li>Is market volatility higher before or after election results are announced, and does this effect differ across sectors?</li>
            <li>How do the broader economic and political context of an election, as well as candidate-specific characteristics, shape market reactions?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
            To address these questions, we rely on historical stock market data, sector-level ETFs, and publicly available election data. 
            Our analysis combines descriptive statistics with regression-based event study methods to isolate election-related effects from broader market movements.
            </p>

        <h3> Nasdaq Insights </h3>
        <p>
            So, what exactly are we looking at when we say “Nasdaq”? Our main dataset is a rich collection of historical stock 
            prices for companies traded on the Nasdaq exchange, along with some ETFs thrown in for context. For those not familiar: 
            ETFs (Exchange-Traded Funds) are like baskets of stocks bundled together. You can think of them as a way to invest in an entire 
            sector without buying every single company individually. Meanwhile, individual stocks let us zoom in on how specific 
            companies react under market stress, election uncertainty, and all the drama that comes with four-year cycles. 
            <br>
            To make our data a bit more insightful, each ticker is annotated with its sector, letting us ask questions like: 
            Does tech freak out more than energy when election season hits? And does healthcare stay surprisingly steady compared to the rest?
            These sector labels are crucial for understanding sector-specific effects during elections.
        </p>

            First ETF appears in 1993, corresponding to S&P 500 ETF inception. Stocks span a longer historical period. Active tickers generally increase over time, with a 
            sharp jump in March 1983 reflecting multiple new listings. Graph below shows coverage of active stocks and ETFs by date.

        <h3>Returns and Log-Returns</h3>

        <p>When we want to measure how a stock is performing, the first thing that comes to mind is: 
            how much did it move today? In finance, this is captured by returns. At its simplest, 
            the daily return of a stock is the relative change in price from one day to the next.
        </p>

        <!--Returns-->

            <div class="details-content">
                <p>
                    To compute how much a stock earns we take the difference in value to the next period \(V_f\)
                    divided by value at the start of the period \(V_i\).
                </p>
        
                <div class="math-block">
                    $$ R = \frac{V_f - V_i}{V_i} $$
                </div>
        
                <p>
                    In practice, we usually use for value the adjusted close prices and for the period days. 
                    Adjusted close prices account for corporate actions like stock splits, dividends, 
                    and spin-offs, so they reflect the true economic value of holding the stock. This 
                    gives us a simple, intuitive sense of performance: positive numbers mean gains, negative numbers mean losses.
                </p>
            </div>
        </details>

        <p>However, a commonly used alternative is the logarithmic return (or log return). Rather than measuring 
            relative change directly, it is defined as the natural logarithm of the ratio of consecutive prices.
        </p>

        <!--Log returns-->
        <details class="collapsible info-dropdown">
            <summary class="info-box">
                <svg class="chevron" viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true">
                    <path d="M6 9l6 6 6-6" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round"
                        stroke-linejoin="round" />

                <span>Log-Returns</span>
            </summary>

                    $$r_t = \log\frac{V_t}{V_{t-1}}$$
                </p>
            </div>

            <p>Why go through the trouble? The magic property of log returns is time additivity: 
                the log return over multiple days is just the sum of daily log returns. This makes it 
                trivial to compute cumulative returns over a period. For example, if a stock gains 1% 
                on day 1 and loses 1% on day 2, the cumulative log return is exactly zero—something that 
                doesn’t hold with regular returns.
            </p>
            <p><b>Kurtosis</b></p>
             <p>
            Kurtosis measures how much of the data lies in the tails of a distribution—essentially, how likely 
            extreme events are. One additional advantage of using log returns is that they tend to reduce kurtosis,
            smoothing out the “fat tails” often seen in standard returns. This makes the distribution closer to normal, 
            which is particularly helpful for statistical analysis, modeling, and comparing sectors or stocks. The differences 
            are subtle and usually invisible in histograms, as they appear mainly in rare, extreme price moves.
             </p>

        <h3>Alpha and Beta</h3>

        <p>
            Not all stocks move the same way when the market shifts. Beta measures how sensitive a stock is to overall market movements, 
            which we track here using the S&P 500 as the market reference. A beta above 1 means the stock tends to amplify market swings 
            (tech stocks, for example), while a beta below 1 means it’s more stable (utilities are classic examples).
            <br>
            But some companies consistently outperform (or underperform) the market in ways that can’t be explained by beta alone. 
            That’s alpha: positive alpha means the stock does better than expected given its beta, negative alpha means it lags behind.
        </p>

        <!--Alpha and Beta-->
        <details class="collapsible info-dropdown">

                    explained by the market, and \(\epsilon_i\) the residual, or abnormal return.

        <h3>Abnormal Returns and Cumulative Abnormal Returns (CAR)</h3>
        <p> 
            Having defined alpha and beta, we can now isolate what truly interests us in an event-driven analysis: 
            the part of returns that cannot be explained by general market movements. These unexplained deviations 
            are what we refer to as abnormal returns, and they form the core building block of an event study 
            and can be aggregated over time into cumulative abnormal returns (CAR) to assess total impact.
        </p>

                    Abnormal returns correspond to the residual term of the market model. Intuitively, they capture 
                    how much a stock (or sector) moves beyond what would normally be expected given its exposure to 
                    the market.

                <p>
                    A positive abnormal return indicates that the asset outperformed its expected return on that day, 
                    while a negative value signals underperformance. In the context of elections, these deviations are 
                    precisely what may reflect shifts in political expectations or policy uncertainty.

                <p>
                    Cumulative abnormal returns allow us to assess whether an event leads to a persistent revaluation 
                    of assets, rather than a short-lived fluctuation. This makes CAR a natural metric for comparing 
                    the impact of elections across sectors.

        <h3>Estimators of Volatility</h3>
        
                <p>
                    Returns typically fluctuate around zero, as prices move up and down around a longer-term trend. During periods 
                    of stress - such as the 2008 financial crisis (see figure below) - these fluctuations become noticeably larger, 
                    reflecting a sharp increase in volatility. Observations from past crises offer a useful reference for the kinds 
                    of volatility we might anticipate during elections.
                    <br>
                    To move beyond visual impressions, we quantify this behavior using the standard deviation of returns over a rolling window. 
                    This measure provides an estimate of how volatile the market has been recently and is commonly referred to as historical 
                    volatility.

                    Volatility is the finance term for the standard deviation. It can be computed using usual unbiased
                    standard
                    deviation formula with a rolling window.

        <p>
            Sectors generally follow the overall market trend, with spikes in volatility during events that shake the entire economy, 
            like the 2008 financial crisis or the market drop in August 2011. But a closer look reveals that not all sectors react 
            equally, some are more sensitive to specific events. Take the energy sector, for example: between 2005 and 2007, it showed 
            above the market volatility as Middle East conflicts and other factors drove oil prices up and down. Most other sectors barely 
            flinched. Similarly, the technology sector experienced heightened volatility from 2001 to 2003 after the dot-com bubble burst, 
            while other industries remained relatively stable.
        </p>

        <P>
            These patterns already hint at something important for our study: sector-specific analysis matters. Around elections,
            different policy proposals - think climate change, Big Tech regulation, or healthcare reform - will impact sectors 
            in very different ways.
        </P>

        <p>
            Now, historical volatility is easy to compute and widely used for long-term analysis and risk management. But it comes with 
            limitations: it requires a sufficiently large window to give reliable estimates, which can smooth over the short-term 
            fluctuations we’re interested in around election dates. It also only considers close prices, ignoring intraday swings 
            that can happen when markets react swiftly to news. For this reason, we turn to <b>Parkinson’s volatility estimator</b>, which 
            leverages the day’s high and low prices to provide a more responsive measure - perfect for capturing those quick market moves 
            around elections.

        <h2>Making Sense of Sectors</h2>

        <h3>When Sectors Correlate (and When They Don’t)</h3>

        <p>
            One useful way to understand how sectors behave is by looking at correlations. If the correlation between two sectors is 1,
            they move in lockstep meaning: what happens in one affects the other directly. A correlation of 0 means they are essentially independent, 
            and a correlation of -1 implies they move in exactly opposite directions. By visualizing correlations across sectors over the past, 
            and highlighting key events such as the 2008 financial crisis, the 2016 US election, and the 2020 Covid crisis, we can see how different
            events influence these relationships.
        </p>

        <p>
            Our analysis confirms what we might expect: companies within the same sector generally move together, showing consistently 
            higher correlations than companies in different sectors. However, inter-sector correlations aren’t static, they shift depending 
            on the event. Take the 2008 financial crisis, for example. Consumer Defensive stocks suddenly correlated strongly with Energy 
            and Healthcare sectors, reflecting how systemic shocks ripple through the entire economy. A similar story unfolds during the Covid-19 crash.
            These dynamics can be explored interactively in our dashboard below, where you can filter by sector and event to observe how correlations evolve over time.
        </p>

        <p>
            Interestingly, the 2016 election tells a different tale. Correlations across sectors actually decreased, even when compared 
            to a 20-year baseline. In a sense, the election “uncoupled” sectors, highlighting how political events can trigger unique, 
            sector-specific reactions depending on candidates’ policy positions. This finding reinforces our hypothesis that elections 
            lead to idiosyncratic sector responses.

        <h3>Tracking Sector Performance with ETFs</h3>

        <p>
            So how can we capture the performance and volatility of an entire sector? Throughout our analysis so far, we have 
            relied on sector-specific ETFs as our main reference, and we will continue to do so for good reasons. Specifically, 
            we use the Select Sector SPDR family, well-established ETFs that track the companies within each S&P 500 sector. Each ETF 
            is market-cap weighted, with roughly half of the holdings concentrated in the top ten companies, ensuring that sector performance 
            is driven by the companies that matter most.
        </p>

        <p>
            This approach has clear advantages over simply averaging the volatilities of all individual stocks in a sector. 
            Large companies naturally have a greater impact on sector performance, so a naive average would dilute their influence. 
            At the same time, smaller companies tend to be more volatile, often due to low trading volumes rather than true sector trends. 
            Giving them equal weight would artificially inflate perceived sector volatility.
        </p>

        <p>
            To see this in practice, we compared sector volatility calculated as a simple average of individual stocks to the volatility of the corresponding ETF.
        </p>

        <img src="assets/img/placeholders/ph7.png">

        <p>
            The histograms on the left reveal an interesting pattern: on any given day, the distribution of volatilities within 
            a sector is right-skewed. Most companies cluster around a central volatility value, but a handful of outliers spike much 
            higher. This aligns with our earlier intuition that smaller companies, which are more sensitive to day-to-day trading, can 
            disproportionately influence simple averages. In the healthcare sector, for example, TLGT (Teligent Inc.) stands out with a 
            volatility of 0.36. At the time, it was a tiny pharmaceutical company with a market capitalization of just $10 million.
        </p>

        <p>
            Unsurprisingly, this explains why a naive calculation, simply averaging all individual stock volatilities, consistently 
            overestimates the sector’s volatility, as shown on the line plots on the right. What’s somewhat surprising, though, is 
            that despite this overestimation, the naive approach still captures historical patterns over two decades and isn’t as noisy 
            as one might expect. Using the median instead of the mean slightly improves the estimate, but overestimation persists.
        </p>

        <p>
            For all these reasons, we continue to rely on sector ETFs to study sector variations. They provide a more accurate, 
            market-cap-weighted picture, and are also more computationally efficient for our analysis.

        <h2>Event study</h2>

        <p>
            Now that we have covered all the tools, we can finally dive into the exciting part: seeing how elections actually move 
            the market. Here’s how we tackle it in our analysis:
        </p>

        <ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Defining the Event Window:</strong>
        The event at the center of our study is Election Day. To capture both anticipatory jitters and the immediate market reaction,
        we look at a symmetric window spanning a few trading days before and after the vote. For this study, we focus on a <b>5-day </b>
        window: short enough to isolate the election effect, long enough to see the market respond.
    </li>

    <li>
        <strong>Measuring Returns and Volatility</strong><br>
        Within this window, we calculate the realized stock returns and volatility metrics. These numbers tell us what actually 
        happened in the market, giving us a snapshot of the collective investor response.
    </li>

    <li>
        <strong>Comparing to Expected Values</strong><br>
        The heart of an event study lies in defining “normal” behavior. Using models that account for market exposure and sector 
        characteristics, we estimate expected returns and volatility. By comparing realized values to these expectations, we can 
        quantify the abnormal performance directly associated with the event.
    </li>

    <li>
        <strong>Aggregating and Testing Significance</strong><br>
        To see the bigger picture, we aggregate results across sectors and multiple election cycles. Statistical tests then help 
        us decide whether the effects we observe are meaningful or just random noise. This allows us to infer whether elections 
        consistently influence market behavior.
    </li>
</ul>

        <h3>Abnormal returns based event study</h3>
<!-- 
        <p>
            Let us use this method to analyze the impact of the 2016 presidential election on different sectors.
        </p>

        </p>

        <img src="assets/img/placeholders/ph8.png"> -->

        <p>
            Before we dive into the 2016 numbers, a quick refresher: we’re looking at abnormal returns—the part of a stock 
            or sector’s performance that can’t be explained by general market moves—and their cumulative version, CAR, which sums
            these deviations over a short window. Think of it as a way to spotlight which sectors are really reacting to the election, 
            rather than just following the market’s general mood. It’s a sharp lens for catching the market’s political volatility spike.
            With this framework in mind, let’s turn to the 2016 presidential election and see how sectors actually behaved, as illustrated 
            in the figure below (you will have to click on Trumps picture of 2016).

        </p>

        <p>
            Visualizing the CAR around the election, the financial sector jumps right off the chart. Over the five-day window, 
            it clocked in an impressive 8.8% cumulative abnormal return, leaving all other sectors in the dust. Most of the action 
            happened in the first two days post-election, as the market digested the shock and started pricing in deregulation promises for big banks.

        </p>

        <p>
            The industrial sector also enjoyed a boost, likely reflecting optimism around pro-American industrial policies. Pre-election 
            CARs for both Financials and Industrials were modest, showing that the real market reaction only kicked in once the results were clear. 
            Technology, in contrast, saw a decline of about 4% over the same window. At first glance, this might seem counterintuitive today, given Trump’s 
            later relationships with tech leaders. But at the time, his campaign rhetoric was critical of big tech—pointing to outsourcing and 
            antitrust concerns—so the market’s caution makes perfect sense. These contrasting movements highlight how sector-specific policies
            and perceptions shape investor reactions in very different ways.
        </p>

        <p>
            Statistical tests to show significance: little statistical tables, which sector is significant, dividing by Democrat-win
            vs republican win or not. <br>
