        <h2> Abstract </h2>
        <p>It is an established fact that presidential elections have a significant impact on the stock market.
            Investors react
            to the uncertainty and potential policy changes that come with a new administration. Understanding these
            dynamics
            can help investors anticipate these movements and hedge their portfolios around election cycles. These
            insights also
            provide a window into the market's perceptions of different candidates and their proposed policies.
            <br>
            In this project, we explore how presidential elections influence company performance and investor sentiment
            over
            time. Using historical stock market data, election results, and prediction market trends, we look at how
            markets
            move as the likelihood of one candidate winning changes. We focus especially on how different sectors for
            example
            like technology, energy, healthcare, and finance, respond to the uncertainty and outcomes of election
            cycles.
            <br>
            Our goal is to show how politics and markets move together in a clear, data-driven way. By analyzing past
            elections
            and the upcoming 2024 race, we hope to uncover patterns that explain when, why, and how the market reacts.
        </p>

        <h3>Research questions</h3>
        <p>
            Can we describe an entire sector? Do sectors have any significance in terms of shared financial behaviour? are they
            affected differently? Which sectors are most affected by presidential elections? What characteristics of elections lead
            to increased volatility? Does the president's party differentiably impact certain sectors? To answer these questions, we
            will use historical stock market data and publicly available election data. We will also use prediction market data as
            proxy for the perceived probability of each candidate winning.

            utilities, a very stable sector, tend to have a beta less than 1. Similarly, some companies provide returns that cannot
            simply be explained by market movements, they consistently outperform the market, they are said to have a positive
            alpha.

        <h3>Estimators of Volatility</h3>

        <p>
            Returns tend to be centered around 0 as prices oscillate around a trend. During the 2008 crisis, we observe an increase
            in volatility, with more pronounced fluctuations. This pattern of high volatility could be indicative of what we expect
            around election dates as well, although less pronounced. We can quantify this volatility using standard deviation of
            returns over a rolling window. This estimate of volatility is referred to as historical volatility
        </p>

                    Volatility is the finance term for the standard deviation. It can be computed using usual unbiased

                    deviation formula with a rolling window.

        <p>
            Sectors typically follow the overall market trend, with increased volatility during events affecting the entire economy,
            such as the 2008 financial crisis or the August 2011 market fall. However, this simple visualization hints that sectors
            can exhibit different levels of volatility, responding to events that preferentially impact them. A good example is the
            energy sector that showed above-market volatility from 2005 to 2007, as conflicts in the Middle East and other factors
            influenced oil prices. Other sectors were largely unaffected during that period. Similarly, the years 2001-2003 saw
            increased volatility in the technology sector following the burst of the dot-com bubble, while other sectors remained
            relatively stable.
        </p>

        <P>
            This already supports our hypothesis that sector-specific analysis is important to capture the full impact of elections.
            As candidates take different stances on issues like climate change, regulation of Big Tech or healthcare reform, sectors
            will be differentially affected!
        </P>

        <p>
            while historical volatility is easy to compute and is typically used for long-term analysis and risk management, it has
            its limitations. It needs a sufficiently large window size to provide reliable estimates, which can smooth out the
            day-to-day fluctuations we aim to capture around election dates. Additionally, since it is only based on close prices,
            it ignores intraday price movements. In the context of elections, market reactions can be swift and get resolved within
            the same trading day. For these reasons, we use Parkinson's volatility estimator, which leverages high and low prices
            within the trading day to provide a more responsive measure

        <h2>How do you describe the performance of an entire sector? Does it make sense to talk of sector?</h2>

        <h3>Does it make economic sense: correlations</h3>

        <p>
            financial definition of a sector: sharing risks. yahoo finance provides 11 sector denominations? Is it just our tendency
            to categorize or is there really an economic reality of similar reactions within a sector? Is the distinction
            economically sound? we selected and visualized corr.
        </p>

        <p>
            [graph: correlation matrix over 20 years, and other events]
        </p>

        <img src="assets/img/placeholders/ph6">

        <p>
            This analysis reveals that intra-sector correlations are consistently higher than inter-sector correlations as expected.
            However, inter-sector correlations vary depending on the event. For example, during the 2008 financial Crisis, the
            Consumer Defensive sector correlated strongly with Energy and Healthcare stocks. Events with broad economic impacts
            introduce systemic risks that affect multiple sectors simultaneously, leading to higher correlations across the board.
            The same holds true for the Covid-19 crash.
        </p>

        <p>
            Most interestingly, we see that the 2016 election had the effect of lowering correlations across sectors, even when
            compared to a 20-year correlation baseline. The election seems to "uncouple" sectors from each other. This further
            supports our hypothesis that elections lead to idiosyncratic responses across sectors, as candidates propose policies
            that differentially impact various industries.
        </p>

        <h3>If it does, how do you represent entire sector</h3>

        <p>
            So far, we've used sector-specific ETFs as proxies for the performance and volatility of the entire sectors. This ETF
            family, called Select Sector SPDRs, is a well-established way to track sector performance. [what they are used for, in
            academia, to diversify portfolios] They each contain the companies of their respective sectors that appear in the S&P
            500 index. Each company is weighted by its market capitalization, with around 50% of holding typically concentrated in
            the top 10 companies. This is a better way to track sector volatility than averaging the volatility of all companies in
            the sector for two reasons:
        </p>

        <p>
            1. Large companies affect sector performance more than small companies. A non-weighted average would give equal
            importance to all companies.
            2. Small companies have higher volatility than big companies. This volatility may not be due to sector sentiment but
            rather to the fact that small companies are traded in lower volumes and can be thus be affected by modest day-to-day
            trades. This would artificially inflate sector volatility.
        </p>

        <p>
            Let us verify this by calculating volatility as an average of individual stock volatilities within each sector and
            comparing it to the ETF volatility.
        </p>

        <p>
            [graph of parkinson’s estimated in 2 ways]
        </p>

        <img src="assets/img/placeholders/ph7">

        <p>
            The histograms on the left show that on any specific day, the distribution of volatilities for companies within the same
            sector is right-skewed. Most companies have volatilities clustered around a central value, but a few outliers exhibit
            very high volatilities. This confirms our earlier assumption that small companies, more sensitive to day-to-day trading,
            will skew the average. In the healthcare sector, for example, the outlier is TLGT (Teligent Inc.) reaching a volatility
            0f 0.36. At the time of measurement, Teligent was a small pharmaceutical company with a market capitalization of only
            $10 million.
        </p>

        <p>
            It is thus no surprise that our naive sector volatility calculation consistently overestimates sector volatility as
            shown on the lineplots on the right. However, we are surprised to see that while the naive calculation is an
            overestimation, it nonetheless reproduces closely historical patterns over two decades and is not as noisy as we
            expected. Using the median instead of the mean to aggregate individual stock volatilities slightly improves the
            estimate, but it still remains an overestimation.
        </p>

        <p>
            From now on, we will use sector ETFs to study sector variations for computation efficiency.

        <h2>Event study</h2>

        <p>
            How does one determine how a specific event impacted the performance or volatility of a stock? Tools from event study
            methodology help us answer such questions. Our study will go as follows:
        </p>

        <p>
            - Define an event window around Election Day, the event of interest: we consider both pre- and post-election windows as
            the dates of elections are known and changes in the market could even happen before as investors try to anticipate the
            outcome or hedge their positions.
            - Calculate realized returns or volatility over that window.
            - Compare these values to expected returns and volatility: event studies differ by how they define these expected, or
            normal, values. We will demonstrate two approaches.
            - Aggregate results across different sectors and election cycles and determine statistical significance.

        <h3>Abnormal returns based event study</h3>

        <p>
            let us use abnormal returns to evaluate election impact. abnormal returns defined using alpha and beta, explain why:
        </p>

        <p>
            By ignoring these factors, a naive model may misattribute as event-driven and abnormal returns that simply due to the
            sector's historical characteristics. We thus account for the relationship between sector returns and market returns
            using linear regression. The market model is defined as follows:
        </p>

        <p>
            $$
            R_{i,t} = \alpha_i + \beta_i R_{m,t} + \epsilon_{i,t}
            $$
        </p>

        <p>
            where \( \alpha_i \) is the stock's alpha, \( \beta_i \) is the stock's beta, and \( \epsilon_{i,t} \) is the return not
            explained by the model, aka the abnormal return:
        </p>

        <p>
            $$
            AR_{i,t} = R_{i,t} - (\alpha_i + \beta_i R_{m,t})
            $$
        </p>

        <p>
            It is customary to estimate \( \alpha_i \) and \( \beta_i \) over a large window prior to the window of interest. In our
            example, we will define a 252-day estimation window, corresponding to one trading year. We can then aggregate these
            abnormal returns across our event window to obtain cumulative abnormal returns (CAR):
        </p>

        <p>
            $$
            CAR_{i,t} = \sum_{m \leq t} AR_{i,m}
            $$
        </p>

        <p>
            Let us use this method to analyze the impact of the 2016 presidential election on different sectors.

        <p>
            Look at 2016 for example:<br>
            Visualizing pre- and post-election cumulative abnormal returns shows the sector most impacted by results of the 2016
            presidential election is the energy sector, with a significant cumulative abnormal return of 0.06 over 20 days, crushing
            other sectors. This is consistent with the pro-fossil fuel of the elected Trump administration, as well as the
            expectations of climate deregulation. The lineplot also illustrates a jump in abnormal returns the day of the election,
            as the winner was announced.
        </p>

        <p>
            Funnily enough, pre-election CAR was negative for the energy sector. Those of us who followed the 2016 election remember
            that Hillary Clinton, the more environmentally conscious candidate, was initially predicted to win the election before
            Trump's electoral victory surprised many. This headline from the Wall Street Journal perfectly captures the market
            sentiment that led to the energy sector's soar.
