        <h1> King of White House, Wolf of Wall Street: How US presidential election impact companies' performance on the stockmarket </h1>

        <h1>Money right !?!</h1>

        <p>A game, a necessity, a goal, it is everything to some but nothing to none.</p>

        <h2>Cool dataset but what's the difference between 'Close' and 'Adj Close' ?</h2>
        <p>The close price is the stock valuation on the market, it's price. That price is corrected for 'splits' : an operation that can divide existing shares into a larger number. The adjusted close proce (Adj Close) correct for the splits too but additionaly for the dividends : the money received by each stockholder. The payment of devidends create a sudden drop in price of the stock of exactly the cash value of the dividend because as this money left the firm (to land in your pocket) it diminishes accordingly the share's price.</p>

        <h2>Will the elections affect my returns ?</h2>


        <h2> Abstract </h2>
        <p>It is an established fact that presidential elections have a significant impact on the stock market. Investors react
            to the uncertainty and potential policy changes that come with a new administration. Understanding these dynamics
            can help investors anticipate these movements and hedge their portfolios around election cycles. These insights also
            provide a window into the market's perceptions of different candidates and their proposed policies.
            <br>
            In this project, we explore how presidential elections influence company performance and investor sentiment over
            time. Using historical stock market data, election results, and prediction market trends, we look at how markets
            move as the likelihood of one candidate winning changes. We focus especially on how different sectors for example
            like technology, energy, healthcare, and finance, respond to the uncertainty and outcomes of election cycles.
            <br>
            Our goal is to show how politics and markets move together in a clear, data-driven way. By analyzing past elections
            and the upcoming 2024 race, we hope to uncover patterns that explain when, why, and how the market reacts.

        <h2> What is volatility</h2>
        <p>
            again a very finance-oriented paragraph, maybe paf and eliota can write stuff about how volatility is used in the world
            of trading: paf's discussion of portfolios as a way to bring down volatility, etc. Say that there are two ways of
            measuring volatility: historical volatility (standard deviation of returns over a period) and Parkinson's volatility
            (based on high and low volatility). explain how Parkinson's volatility is more suited for our purpose because it
            captures investor panic that might get resolved within the day, as can be the case in election days.
            
            Also can have a dropdown menu with the formulas
            
            Here we can show the graph of volatility over two decades, showing a rise in volatility around 2008 crisis.
            
            Then, I want to talk about how to define the volatility of a sector, show two approaches: (1) volatility of
            sector-specific ETF, (2) average volatility of all stocks in the sector. Show if the two are correlated and why and
            which one we choose.
        </p>

                <p>
                    Volatility is the finance term for the standard deviation. It can be computed using usual unbiased standard deviation formula with a rolling window.
                </p>

                <p>Formula:</p>
        
                <p class="math-block">
                    $$\sigma = \sqrt{ \frac{1}{N-1} \sum_{t=1}^{N} (\bar{V}^2 - V_t^2) } $$
                </p>
                <p>
                    With
                    \(N\) the selected window, e.g. \(t\) representing a day, \( \bar{V} \) the average price for the given window and \(V_t\) the price on a given \(t\) (e.g. a day).

                    <!-- MathJax formula -->
                    $$\sigma_P = \sqrt{\frac{1}{4 \ln(2)} \cdot \frac{1}{N} \sum_{t=1}^{N} \left( \ln\left(\frac{H_t}{L_t}\right)
                    \right)^2}$$
                </p>
                <p>
                    where $H_t$ and $L_t$ are the high and low prices on day $t$. The factor $\frac{1}{4 \ln(2)}$ is derived from modeling
                    returns as a geometric Brownian motion. Parkinson's volatility still needs to be computed over a window, but it yields
                    accurate estimates with smaller values of $N$, allowing us to better capture short-term variation without sacrificing
                    reliability.

        <h2> What's an event study methodology: how to define abnormal returns </h2>

        <h2> Event studies</h2>
        <p>
        Introduction to event studies, how they are used in finance to measure the impact of specific events on stock prices.
        Describe the concept then have a dropdown menu with formulas with abnormal returns, cumulative abnormal returns, etc.
        
        I finish this text by mentioning how when using event studies, given that a US election is a rare event, we need to look
        at multiple elections over time to get statistically significant results. This will tie nicely into the next section.
        </p>

        <h5> Timeline des elections : </h5>

        <p>J'aime beaucoup ce graph flourish mais (1) j'ai pas l'impression qu'il est assez long pour faire un truc qui scroll,
        c'est un peu awkward comment ca scroll un peu puis ca s'arrete. genre je dirais ou les mettre tous d'un cote (en haut)
        et faire que ca scroll ou garder comme ca mais du croup rapetir un peu et les montrer tous sans scrolling. (2) y'a pas
        moyen de faire que la couleur de fond match le blanc. (3) je vois que y'a des bars rouges en haut de chaque candidat,
        l'idée c'etati de mettre des bars rougs pour les republicains et bleus pour les democrates? (4) peut etre ecrire les
        dates en mode "4 Novembre 2008"plutot que "4-11-2008" (5) vous voulez on fair un truc quand tu hover sur un des cercles
        ca montre un carre avec un petit texte sur l'élection (genre il était contre qui, anything memorable de l'élection etc)
        ?</p>

        <h5> Presidential Impact </h5>

        <img src="assets/img/car_ytb.png" alt="Card picture of each president">


        <h2> Impact of elections on volatility</h2>

        <p>
        Here I show the graphs I do taht are based on volatility:<br>
        - Graph like the one elsa made but by volatility and you can pick the election you want to display the results for it.
        - show which companies and which sectors are most impacted by elections in terms of volatility, bubble hierarchy graph
        from flourish like the one in the youtube datastory<br>
        
        I then talk about statistical significance, I do paired t-tests to show that the volatility after elections is
        significantly different from before elections. (calm before the storm)</p>
        
        <h2> which characteristics of elections impact volatility the most </h2>
        
        <p>
        we do a linear regression where the dependent variable is the change in Cumulative Abnormal Volatility before and after
        the election and the independent variables are characteristics of the elections, like democrat vs republican win, margin
        of victory, economic conditions at the time and sector. I let sector interact with the other variables so we can see
        which sectors are more impacted by which characteristics of elections.</p>
        
        <h2> fine-grained IEM analysis for one election</h2>
        <p>
        I introduce what IEM is, how prediction markets work, how they reflect the beliefs of investors about the likelihood of
        a candidate winning.<br>
        
        Then I show the analysis we did for one election (2020 or 2016), showing how as the IEM probabilities change over time,
        how does the volatility of different sectors change.<br>
        
        If I have time I can do this for multiple elections.</p>
